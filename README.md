# ImpressionistPainter

Impressionist Painter application for Android.

This application was made by Jesse Averbukh on 04/08/16 This application uses example code from these urls:
http://developer.android.com/training/gestures/multi.htmlhttp://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/android-sdk-create-a-drawing-app-essential-functionality--mobile-19328
http://developer.android.com/training/gestures/movement.html

This code is run by first importing it into Android Studio, then right clickig on the src folder and selecting run.

A real Android Phone (Galaxy S5) was used for the creation of this app, so I do not know if it would function any differently with the emulator.

ImpressionistView.java contains the User Interface and MainActivity.java contains most of the backend work. The assorted xml's handle the view that the user has of this application.
